  Late. Sri. Pendekanti Venkata SubbaiahFormer Union Minister of State for Home & Parliamentary Affairs and Former Governor of Bihar and Karnataka




Sri Pendekanti Venkatasubbaiah, one of the veteran statesmen of Independent India,
  held many important positions in his lifetime. He served in the capacities of the
  Union Minister of State for Home & Parliamentary Affairs (1980-84), the Governor
  of Bihar, and later, of Karnataka.
 

  Sri Pendekanti Venkatasubbaiah was born in an affluent family of agriculturists
  on 18th June, 1921 at Sanjamala, a village in the erstwhile Princely State of Banaganapalli
  in Kurnool District of Andhra Pradesh. He took keen interest in the national movement
  while he was a student in Nandyal, the constituency he represented subsequently
  for 27 years in Lok Sabha. He dedicated himself to the national movement and fought
  against oppression and even, braving imprisonment.
 


  Sri Venkatasubbaiah was secular in his outlook throughout his life and fought firmly
  against all kinds of inequalities and oppression. His vision for an egalitarian
  and progressive future reflects in the institutions that he founded and inspired.
 

  A Gandhian to the core, he had a passionate interest in Education, Khadi and Co-operation.
  He started several educational institutions, hostels for poor boys and Co-operative
  Societies.
 

  Vasavi College of Engineering was established in 1981 by Vasavi Academy of Education under the stewardship
  of 
  Late Sri Pendekanti Venkata Subbaiah, a veteran statesman of
  independent India and by a few eminent people from different walks of life.
  
  The College of Engineering represents a rich tradition of excellence in
  technology based education in a stimulating environment.

Embedded Systems & VLSI Design [ECE][ME]


 The present day gadgets of today call for systems, which are self-sustained and self-adjustable for meeting different conditions.
 This calls for processors to be integrated into the products. These are called Embedded Systems. The complex
 circuits are realized using VLSI. Therefore, the course on Embedded Systems & VLSI is appropriate to meet the
 present day needs of the electronic industry. This program has two parts. Part I deals with the requirements of VLSI
 for Embedded Systems, and Part II deals with realization of these VLSI circuits.
 
Faculty

 The department has well-qualified and experienced faculty in the relevant areas of Embedded Systems, Computers,
 Microelectronics and VLSI. Out of the 32 faculty members of the department, nearly 10 of them are actively
 associated with this P.G. Program.
 
Placement

 To carry out this program effectively, the department collaborates with relevant industries and interacts with
 GAETEC. This arrangement enables us to undertake meaningful projects and places students in relevant sectors.
 
Facilities

 The VLSI Design lab was established almost two years ago, and has 20 Compaq P IV systems along with EDA tools from
 Mentor Graphics. In due course, 5 licenses of Synopsis tools will be added.

Communication Engineering & Signal Processing [ECE][ME]


 Traditionally, though "Signal Processing‟ is dealt in analog domain, with the advent of high speed computers, the
 focus has shifted to digital domain, Therefore "Digital Signal Processing‟ has attained prominence. Digital Signal
 Processing finds applications in almost every conceivable field of engineering. Its impact on consumer electronics
 is evidenced by the proliferation of digital communication, digital audio, digital television and digital imaging.
 

 The 3G communication systems employ technologies supported by transmission and channel- assignment techniques such
 as TDMA, CDMA and OFDM. Also, there is a need to develop novel signal transmission techniques. It is important to
 obtain maximal benefit from the various transmission techniques using the diversity techniques along with mitigating
 the impairments of the wireless channel. Therefore, advanced receiver signal processing techniques are also of
 interest.
 

 Wireless communication operations permit services, such as long range communications, without the use of wires. The
 term "wireless" has become a generic and all-encompassing word used to describe communications in which
 electromagnetic waves or RF carry a signal over part or the entire communication path, for example Mobile
 Communication.
 

 Professional Land Mobile Radio and Specialized Mobile Radio typically used by business, industrial and Public
  Safety entities. 
 Consumer and professional Marine VHF radios. 
 Cellular telephones and pagers that provide connectivity for portable and mobile applications, both personal
  and business. 
 Global Positioning System (GPS): allows drivers of cars and trucks, captains of boats and ships, and pilots of
  aircraft to ascertain their location anywhere on earth. 
 Cordless computer peripherals: The cordless mouse is a common example; 
 Keyboards and printers can also be linked to a computer via wireless. 
 Cordless telephone sets: These are limited-range devices, not to be confused with cell phones. 
 Satellite television: It allows viewers in almost any location to select from hundreds of channels. 


 Today, there are many service providers in the wireless communication industry to cater to the increasing demand for
 these services. This necessitates availability of trained and skilled manpower in this area. Therefore, starting a
 postgraduate course in Signal Processing and Communication Systems will be an appropriate choice in ECE department.

Power Systems and Power Electronics [EEE][ME]

 The undergraduate program in Electrical and Electronics Engineering provides the basic foundation of science and
 engineering subjects in the first year and understanding of various core subjects in the field of electrical and
 electronics engineering in the subsequent three years. This knowledge and exposure helps the students to secure jobs
 in various industries as practicing engineers. However, the technological advances in the field of Electrical and
 Electronics Engineering call for graduates specialized in post graduate studies in many industries, institutions and
 research labs. There is a wide gap between supply and demand of electrical energy in India. Various infrastructure
 projects are being undertaken by the Government, Public and Private sectors to bridge this gap. Renewable energy
 sources are also being undertaken from the stand point of environmental considerations and as alternative energy
 sources. Power electronics is making energy conversion quite efficient. It finds application in industries, home
 appliances, consumer industries, transportation, space exploration etc. Presently, power electronics is also used in
 power systems. An in depth knowledge is expected in the field of Power System and Power Electronics. The PG Program
 in “Power Systems and Power Electronics” serves to meet this objective of providing in-depth knowledge.
 
Faculty

 The department has well qualified and experienced faculty from IITs, NITs, BHEL, etc., to offer courses and guide
 students in the PG program in power systems and power electronics.
 
Facilities

 A well-equipped computer simulation laboratory, Power Systems and Power Electronics laboratories are available in the
 Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department to successfully conduct the PG program.
